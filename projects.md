## Exploring the challenge and strategy of identifying automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors

![intro_image](/images/SpeechProjectSnapshot.png){:class="img-responsive"}
While speech input has improved dramatically in the past few years, reviewing and editing the dictated text during non-visual use has been a challenge for people with visual impairments. This project characterizes the challenge of identifying ASR errors in non-visual context.



## Exploring the challenge and strategy of reducing teachable object recognition (TOR) errors

![intro_image](/images/objectrecognition.png){:class="img-responsive"}
This project aims to build a teachable object recognizer (TOR) that helps people with visual impairments to identify objects independently using their smartphones. With a TOR, users can personalize the object recognizer by training the models with their own images. This project addresses two issues to develop this system: non-experts' perception of machine teaching, blind users' challenges of taking photos for training an object recognizer.
