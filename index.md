I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science Dept. at University of Maryland, College Park](http://cs.umd.edu/). My research is about addressing the real-world problems using human-computer interaction and machine learning techniques. Specifically, my current projects explores the interactions between machine learning applications (automatic speech recognizer, teachable object recognizer) and people with visual impairments. My advisor is Professor [Hernisa Kacorri](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~hernisa/) in [iSchool at University of Maryland, College Park](https://ischool.umd.edu/).
